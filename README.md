# Explanation of the Code

This code implements a brute-force solution to the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** for five cities.

The goal is to find the shortest round-trip route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. Here's the explanation:

### Key Parts of the Code

#### 1. **Distance Matrix (`distMatrix`)**:
- A `vector<vector<int>>` matrix represents distances between each pair of cities. For example, `distMatrix[0][1]` is the distance from city **A** to city **B**.
- `INT_MAX` is used to represent an unreachable path between two cities, making the route invalid if it includes that segment.

#### 2. **Route Representation**:
- Cities are indexed (e.g., **0** for **A**, **1** for **B**, etc.), and the route is stored as a `vector<int>`.
- The `cityNames` vector maps city indices to names for more readable output when printing the final route.

#### 3. **`calculateDistance` Function**:
This function calculates the total distance of a route, ensuring that every leg of the route is reachable.

- **Inputs**:
  - `distMatrix`: The distance matrix for city pairs.
  - `route`: The tested route, represented as a sequence of city indices.

- **How It Works**:
  1. **Loop through the Route**: 
     - The distance between each pair of consecutive cities in the route is added to the total distance.
  2. **Unreachable Path Check**: 
     - If any distance is `INT_MAX`, the function immediately returns `INT_MAX`, marking the route as *unreachable*.
  3. **Return to Start Check**: 
     - After looping through all pairs in the route, the distance from the last city back to the starting city is added. If this distance is `INT_MAX`, the route is *unreachable*.

- **Output**:
  - The function returns the total distance for the route if it is valid, or `INT_MAX` if any segment is unreachable.

#### 4. **Main Algorithm (Main Function)**:
- **Initialization**:
  - `distMatrix` defines distances between cities.
  - `cities` holds indices representing each city.
  - `cityNames` is used to translate city indices to names for output.
  - `minDistance` is initialized to `INT_MAX` to track the minimum distance found.
  - `bestRoute` stores the optimal route.

- **Generating Permutations**:
  - The program generates all possible routes by permutating `cities` (except the first city, which is fixed for optimization).
  
- **Route Evaluation**:
  - For each permutation of cities, `calculateDistance()` computes the route's total distance.
  - If the distance is smaller than `minDistance`, the route and its distance become the new `bestRoute` and `minDistance`.

- **Output**:
  - After evaluating all permutations, the program prints the minimum distance and the optimal route (in terms of city names).

#### 5. **Additional Notes**

- **`next_permutation`**:
  - This function generates the next lexicographical permutation of the `cities` vector, enabling a brute-force approach to try all possible city sequences.
  - Fixing the first city (using `cities.begin() + 1`) avoids duplicate routes that differ only in starting points.

- **Efficiency**:
  - This brute-force approach has factorial time complexity (**O(n! * n)**), so it only works efficiently with a small number of cities.
  - For more than 5-10 cities, more advanced algorithms like **Dynamic Programming** (Held-Karp algorithm) or **Heuristic Methods** (e.g., Nearest Neighbor, Simulated Annealing) are needed to solve the problem in a reasonable time frame.
