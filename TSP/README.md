# Explanation of the code

This code implements a brute-force solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for five cities. The goal is to find the shortest round-trip route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point. Here’s an in-depth explanation:

### Key Parts of the Code
Distance Matrix (distMatrix):

A vector<vector<int>> matrix represents distances between each pair of cities. For example, distMatrix[0][1] is the distance from city A to city B.
INT_MAX represents an unreachable path between two cities, making the route invalid if it includes that segment.
Route Representation:

Cities are indexed (0 for A, 1 for B, etc.), and the route is stored as a vector<int>.
cityNames vector maps city indices to names for more readable output.
calculateDistance Function:

This function calculates the total distance of a route, ensuring that every leg of the route is reachable.
The function takes:
distMatrix: the distance matrix for city pairs.
route: the route being tested, represented as a sequence of city indices.
How It Works:
Loop through Route: For each pair of consecutive cities in route, the distance between them is added to totalDistance.
Unreachable Path Check: If any distance is INT_MAX, the function immediately returns INT_MAX, marking the route as invalid.
Return to Start Check: After looping through all pairs in the route, it adds the distance from the last city back to the starting city. If this distance is also INT_MAX, the route is invalid.
The function returns the total distance for the route if valid, or INT_MAX if any segment is unreachable.
Main Algorithm (Main Function):

Initialization:
distMatrix defines distances between cities.
cities holds indices representing each city.
cityNames is used to translate city indices to names for output.
minDistance is initialized to INT_MAX to track the minimum distance found.
bestRoute stores the optimal route.
Generating Permutations:
The program generates all possible routes by permutating cities (except the first city, which is fixed for optimization).
Route Evaluation:
For each permutation of cities, calculateDistance() computes the route's total distance.
If the distance is smaller than minDistance, the route and its distance become the new bestRoute and minDistance.
Output:
After evaluating all permutations, the program prints the minimum distance and the optimal route (in terms of city names).
Code Execution Example:

For a given distMatrix, an example output might be:
Minimum distance: 7
Best route: A B E D C A
This indicates that the minimum distance found is 7, with the optimal route being A -> B -> E -> D -> C -> A.
Additional Notes
next_permutation:
This function generates the next lexicographical permutation of the cities vector, enabling a brute-force approach to try all possible city sequences.
Fixing the first city (using cities.begin() + 1) avoids duplicate routes that differ only in starting points.
Efficiency:
This brute-force approach has factorial time complexity, so it only works efficiently with a small number of cities. For more than 5-10 cities, more advanced algorithms like dynamic programming or heuristic methods are needed.
This code is a clear example of brute-force TSP for a small set of cities, checking all possible routes to find the minimum distance while filtering out any route that includes unreachable segments.
